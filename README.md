# Build-Data-Dashboards

## Overview
In this project, you will create data visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. The goal is to create visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data, employing the theory and practice of data visualization, including visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the US Census Demographic Data for all counties in 2015, obtained from Kaggle. You can find the dataset in the supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

## Required Dashboards
You are required to create three visualizations. Here are some suggested areas and questions you can explore:

1. **Which states have the best transportation?**
   - Define what "best transportation" means. Is it the highest percentage of transit use or the lowest mean commute times?
   - Determine the appropriate way to aggregate the data from the county level to the state level.
   - Consider outliers that may affect the data and determine how to handle them.
   - Provide your reasoning and explanation in your report.

2. **How does income and poverty look across America?**
   - Explore the relationship between income and poverty across different counties.
   - Contrast the data to uncover interesting findings. For example, examine if counties with more construction experience more or less poverty, or if counties near the coast have higher or lower income levels.
   - Remember to report descriptive statistics and correlations rather than drawing causal relationships.

3. **Your own question**
   - As you work with the data, come up with a question that you are curious about and can be answered using the dataset.
   - Build a dashboard or story that effectively answers your question and guides viewers to the answer.

Feel free to use various visualization techniques and tools to present your findings and insights effectively.

## Conclusion
The Build-Data-Dashboards project provides an opportunity to practice data visualization techniques and effectively communicate insights from the US Census Demographic Data. By exploring different areas, such as transportation, income, poverty, and other factors, you can uncover interesting patterns and correlations within the dataset. Use visual encodings, design principles, and effective storytelling to convey your findings in an engaging manner.
